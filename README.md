# Time Series Prediction Pipeline

This time series prediction pipeline is an illustration of how to combine data engineering using tidyverse tools, time series preprocessing using recipes from R and tsfresh from Python within the same R Markdown document, and time series forecasting using a tidymodels framework.  

This example currently utilizes open data from [Fried and colleagues](https://osf.io/t7g4f/) on mental health in university students at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. This pipeline has also been adapted to predict emotion dynamics and proprietary outcomes.
